## What is NCL?

National Cyber League (NCL) is a cybersecurity competition targeted to students to help build their hacking and analytical skills. While you can read the competition on their [homepage](https://www.nationalcyberleague.org/), here is my description that breaks down the structure to a more granular level.

NCL occurs twice a year during the Fall and Spring season. Each season has three series of games: Preseason, Individual, and Team Game. In each game, there are challenges in various categories to solve (So far, I've played both Spring 2019 and Fall 2019 and the categories were the same in both). 

This is my first post in my series about NCL where I will write a separate post about each category and helpful tips to solve each category's challenges.

Even though the NCL competition itself is targeted towards students and many of the teams are school teams, I found myself enjoying doing the challenges even after I graduated.
